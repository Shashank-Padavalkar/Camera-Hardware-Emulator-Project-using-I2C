# Camera-Hardware-Emulator-Project-using-I2C
A camera emulator using Arduino Uno R4, communicating with Jetson AGX Orin over I2C. Developed a custom protocol over 3-GPIO pins for control signal transmission (GCP-3). Simulated image data transmission with controlled errors (bit flips, missing pixels, timing delays) and testing error detection and correction mechanisms.
